					<h2>Importance of a passion :</h2>
					<p>Engaging in a hobby isn't just a pastime; it's a psychological investment in personal well-being and future success. Hobbies provide an avenue for self-expression, relaxation, and creativity, offering a valuable escape from the stresses of daily life. Psychologically, having a passion fosters a sense of purpose and fulfillment, boosting self-esteem and overall happiness. Furthermore, hobbies often require dedication, patience, and skill development, all of which are transferable to various aspects of life, including professional endeavors. By pursuing interests outside of work or academic obligations, individuals develop a more balanced lifestyle, which can lead to increased productivity, resilience, and overall success in their future pursuits.</p>

					<h2>My hobbies:</h2>
					<p> <ul id="int-L">
						<li><strong>Discovery to self-expression:</strong> Engaging in twelve years of dance offers an enriching journey that extends far beyond mastering choreography and technique. Through countless hours of practice, performances, and creative exploration, I was able to develop a profound sense of confidence and self-expression.
						</li>
					
						
						<li> <strong>Path to my future: </strong>I found that participating in a one-week summer school program at Bocconi University focused on luxury and fashion can be transformative, guiding myself towards my purpose in the business world. Immersed in a rich learning environment, I was able to gain valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of these industries, from branding strategies to consumer behavior.This intensive experience prompted me into self-reflection and exploration, enabling me to align my skills, values, and aspirations with a meaningful career path.

					<h2>My past: </h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Before my studies, I followed all of my schooling in an <strong>Anglo-Saxon institution</strong> with a strong international diversity. My twelve years in Dubai as well as numerous travels have allowed me to learn to navigate in a multicultural and cosmopolitan environment.  </li>
							<li>Dubai, known for its cosmopolitan environment, serves as a melting pot of cultures, languages, and traditions from around the globe. Growing up in such a diverse setting exposed me to <strong>a multitude of perspectives</strong>, beliefs, and lifestyles from an early age. This exposure cultivates an appreciation for diversity and a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of the world. </li>
						</ul>
				</div>



				<div class="card-white">
					<h2>Personal ambitions: </h2>
					<p> My goal for the future, besides my professional life, is to always <strong>keep a passion</strong>; for example traveling. Exploring different countries offers a transformative journey that goes beyond sightseeing, immersing travelers in diverse cultures, landscapes, and experiences. Each destination presents <strong>unique opportunities</strong> to learn and grow, potentially broadening my perspective and understanding of the world. For instance, I would like to visit Japan to gain insights into the value of tradition, discipline, and respect deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, while exploring the vibrant streets of India teaches resilience, adaptability, and the beauty of chaos. Meanwhile, a journey through the wilderness of Iceland also seems tempting as it offers lessons in solitude, introspection, and the power of nature's forces.
